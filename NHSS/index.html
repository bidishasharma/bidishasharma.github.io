<font size="+3"><p>We present a corpus of parallel recordings of speech and singing, collected and released by the Human Language Technology (HLT) laboratory at the National University of Singapore (NUS), that is called NUS-HLT Speak-Sing (NHSS)
database. We release this database to the public for research activities, that include, but not limited to, comparative
studies of acoustic attributes of speech and singing signals, cooperative synthesis of speech and singing voices, and speech-to-singing conversion. This database consists of recordings of sung vocals of English pop songs, the spoken counterpart
of lyrics of the songs read by the singers in their natural reading manner, and manually prepared utterance-level and
word-level annotations. The audio recordings in the NHSS database correspond to a total of 100 songs sung and spoken
by 10 singers, resulting in total of 7 hours audio data. There are 5 male and 5 female singers, singing and reading the
lyrics of 10 songs each. In this paper, we discuss the design methodology of the database, analyze the similarities and dissimilarities in characteristics of speech and singing voices, and provide some strategies to address relationships between
these characteristics for converting one to another. We develop benchmark systems for speech-to-singing alignment,
spectral mapping and conversion using the NHSS database.</p></font>
